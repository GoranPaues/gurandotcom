## Sending emails from a database in the Oracle Cloud (OCI)

Email Delivery Service is the only way to send emails from a database in OCI at time of writing. Later I will update on how to configure an autonomous database for sending emails.

For reference, here is a price comparison with other cloud email services for sending large amount of emails:

| Service | Price | Link |
---------|----------|---------|
 Oracle Email Delivery Service | $0.085	for every 1000 emails sent| https://www.oracle.com/cloud/networking/email-delivery.html |
 Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) | $0.10 for every 1,000 emails you send. | https://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/ |
 SendGrid | $749 for 1.5m emails a month (estimate of >$1200 for 3m pser month | https://sendgrid.com/pricing/ |
 Postmark | $900 for 3m emails a month | https://postmarkapp.com/pricing |
